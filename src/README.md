# Lavande AI

Lavande AI is an innovative web application that brings real-time fashion transformation to live video streams using the power of AI. Built with creators, influencers, and fashion-forward users in mind, Lavande AI lets users apply virtual makeup, jewelry, hats, and other accessories while live-streaming through their webcam.

## 🛠️ Built with ChatAndBuild

Lavande AI was created using [ChatAndBuild](https://chatandbuild.com/), a no-code AI platform that enables users to build and deploy applications through conversational prompts. This approach allowed for rapid development and deployment without writing a single line of code.
